## Discussion and Limitations

(GEORGIA SPECIAL ELECTION)

Recall that the Georgia special election actually has multiple Republicans and Democrats running on the same ballot. If, as expected, no candidate wins over 50% of the vote, the top two finishers will have a one-on-one runoff election in January (Ballotpedia, 2020). Instead of dealing with this in a two-round fashion, our model simply sums up the support for Republican candidates and compares that to the sum of the support for Democratic candidates, then treats this election like others. This is not the most satisfying way to deal with this. However, trying to predict polling and turnout for a special election in January with no other races on the ballot is very difficult, since circumstances will differ greatly from the elections being held concurrently with the Presidential election. Additionally, the political environment that currently favors Democrats may evaporate if, for example, Republicans are energized to push back against a newly elected Joe Biden (Nilsen, 2020). For these reasons, the sparse polling that has currently been done for head-to-head candidate matchups may not at all reflect the circumstances of this race come January, and we chose not to model this runoff race separately given all of these unknowns. Instead, by summing the Republican and Democratic support, we essentially assume that partisan support will consolidate around one candidate for each party and will remain about balanced between the two parties.

(LACK OF CORRELATION BETWEEN MODELS)

One desirable feature of our models that we did not include is some kind of correlation between simulations of the Presidential, House, and Senate elections. For instance, if Joe Biden wins the Presidential election by a wide margin, we would also expect Democrats to do better in the House and Senate elections comapred to if Biden did not win (Desilver, 2020). This is especially true by state; if Biden wins North Carolina by a wide margin, this would likely help Democrat Cal Cunningham win the NC Senate race. Additionally, since the Vice President can determine Senate control in the case of a 50/50 split in seats, having model correlations could help account for this dependence between Senate control and Presidential results. Instead, all of our models simply run independently and we assume in the Senate model that Democrats will control the Senate in the case of a 50/50 split given Biden's high chances of winning in our Presidential model.

(SPLITTING INDEPENDENT VOTERS EVENLY)

For making our prior of Democrat vote share, we assume that registered Democrats and Republicans will vote for their party's candidate, and then we split unaffiliated voters evenly between the two parties. FiveThirtyEight's models such as the 2020 President and Senate models allocate undecided voters in polls 50/50 as well, so our assumption is in line with standard approaches. However, other reasonable approaches could have been to allocate unaffiliated voters proportionally to partisan support within the state of interest, or even to calculate the split based on Trump's overperformance of polls in 2016 based on winning over undecided voters (Golshan, 2016). Such approaches have been explored in the past by FiveThirtyEight (Silver, 2008) but are not the norm.

(LACK OF POLL WEIGHTING)

As discussed earlier, we incorporate all polls of likely voters from within 30 days of the election in our President and Senate models. (For the House model, given the sparse amount of polling, we use all polls available, which is still not very many.) A limitation of our model is that we did not explicitly weight any polls more strongly than others. Poll-based models often weight polls based on recency of the poll, sample size, and pollster quality (Silver, 2014). Our model actually does take into account poll recency, since our prior specification assumes that polls closer to election day have less variance (noise) around the true level of candidate support. However, we do not weight based on sample size or pollster quality. While it would have been possible to do this, it would have required making many arbitrary decisions. For example, what is a "good" sample size, and how heavily should sample size be weighted? How do we determine pollster quality, especially if we don't just want to blindly use FiveThirtyEight's pollster ratings? We decided to avoid these issues, especially since it has been observed that such adjustments rarely have a large impact on models (Silver, 2014).

(POLLING)

There are inherent limitations to modeling elections based on polls. In some cases, as with the U.S. House races in North Carolina, there may be few polls or no polls for a given district. Even when polling data is plentiful, such as in most battleground states in the President and Senate models, we are essentially assuming that the polls are reasonably accurate measures of candidate support. It has been well-documented that systematic polling errors during the 2016 election cycle underestimated the support of then-candidate Trump. While many pollsters have adjusted their sample weighting methods (for example, to adjust for education level of those polled), it is not out of the question that we could witness a 2016-level polling error again (Skelley, 2020). It has also been noted that registered Democrats have been overrepresented in recent polling samples compared to their proportion of the population overall, though pollsters and analysts generally claim that equal partisan representation is not necessary in these samples (Cohn, 2020).

(NO COVARIANCE IN HOUSE & SENATE MODELS)

We do account for state-by-state correlations in our President model, but we do not for the Senate model or the House model. Although there is likely still some correlation in these cases, such races are generally a bit more localized (Gillespie et al. 2020) and incumbency advantages can buck national trends. As a result, we treated these races as being more independent and uncorrelated. Possible ideas for addressing this could be to try to compute our own covariances between districts based on voter demographics, or for the Senate to try predicting covariance between states that is similar to that in the Presidential model but "weaker".
